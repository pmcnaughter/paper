# Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa.

Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004).

Jones at al (1998) conducted several studies in this region, but continential-scale measurements have not previously been made.

A large uncertainty in the modelling BBOA is the extent to which measurements in the literature can be applied at a regional level.
