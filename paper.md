# Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa.

Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004).

Jones at al (1998) conducted several studies in this region, but continential-scale measurements have not previously been made.

A large uncertainty in the modelling BBOA is the extent to which measurements in the literature can be applied at a regional level.

# Methology
We compared out measurements of particle aging with a model simulation. 
The model is detailed in Smith et al 2002.

#Results
The simulations indicate that coagulation is the dominant growth mechanism for these particles.

# Figures
Figures go in teir own section in a draft paper.

#Conclusions
We have made fantastic insight into the BBOA aging process.
Nonetheless, questions remain unanswered, so we should get some more funding.
